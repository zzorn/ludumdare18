My entry for the Ludum Dare 18 game developement competition ( http://www.ludumdare.com/ )

The theme was "Enemies as Weapons".

I will be trying to make a 3D world with wobbly geometric primitive shaped enemies, that they player can knock down and use as ammo.

See development_journal.txt in the repository for a running commentary on the progress.
